This repository contains code for validating and analysing trait empathy and state empathy constructs, as well as investigating the relationship between these constructs and physiological signals during a VR-based empathy-induction experiment.

Folder Structure:
trait-empathy:
Contains code for validating trait empathy questionnaires, focusing on cognitive and affective dimensions of empathy. This includes the analysis of different trait empathy measures, factor structures, and reliability metrics.

state-empathy:
Contains code for validating state empathy questionnaires, which measure temporary emotional responses in specific situations. The code includes validation of these measures and comparisons of different state empathy tools.

physiological-signals:
Contains code for analyzing heart rate (HR) and galvanic skin response (GSR) data, collected while participants watched a VR video designed to evoke empathy. This code compares physiological signals against selected trait and state empathy questionnaires to explore how these constructs correlate with physiological responses during the empathy-inducing experience.

Overview:
This repository supports the analysis of trait empathy and state empathy, two important dimensions of empathy that differ in terms of their time frame and context:

- Trait Empathy: A person's general tendency to experience empathy across various situations, typically assessed through self-report questionnaires on cognitive and affective empathy.
- State Empathy: A temporary emotional response to a specific situation, often assessed through measures taken immediately after an empathy-induction experience.
Additionally, the repository explores how these empathy constructs relate to physiological signals (heart rate and GSR) while participants engage with empathy-inducing content in a VR environment.
