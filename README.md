# Validation of empathy questionnaires
Empathy is measured using numerous questionnaires, many of which claim to assess the same constructs but differ in their focus and structure. This project validates empathy measures by examining trait (cognitive & affective) and state empathy, ensuring they reliably capture these constructs.

- **Trait Empathy** refers to a person's general tendency or disposition to experience empathy across various situations, typically measured through questionnaires assessing cognitive and affective components.  
- **State Empathy** refers to the temporary emotional experience or response to a specific situation, often assessed in response to a particular event or context.
- 
The R code in this repository processes survey data, computes reliability metrics, and assesses factor structures to evaluate how well these questionnaires align with theoretical empathy dimensions.

### **Questionnaires were extracted for use based on their common application in the literature, but were limited to those with available open-access scoring metrics.**

The questionnaires analysed include:
